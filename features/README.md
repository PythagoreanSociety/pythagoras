Feature Specifications
----------------------

Please place feature specifications in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) language here.

There are a few rules we'd like you to follow:

 * Each term you introduce in the feature files should be added to the glossary.

 * Terms should be capitalized like this: *Term One*

 * Each scenario should have just one main action described by the *When* clause.

 * Please keep the step descriptions self-contained, do not refer to entities in other steps using pronouns.
 
 * Remember that test writers should be able to transform each of the step descriptions into a code block without referring to other steps in the same or different scenarios.
