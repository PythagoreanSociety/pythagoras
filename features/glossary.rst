Glossary
--------

_`System`
 the environment where Agents are interacting with each other and other Systems 

_`Node`
 a basic component of the System that may be a `Primitive Node`_ or a `Complex Node`_ that has zero or more Ports
 
_`Connector`
 a basic component of the System that represents a directed connection between Nodes

_`Port`
 an attribute of a `Node`_ that allows Connectors to be attached to it. Can be an `Input Port`_ or an `Output Port`_
 
_`Graph`
 a set of Nodes and Connectors representing one of the aspects of the system: `Composition Tree`_, `Type Hierarchy`_ or `Data Flow Chart`_

_`Input Port`
 a Port that allows data to flow into a `Node`

_`Output Port`
 a Port that allows data to flow out of a `Node`
 
_`Composition Tree`
 a tree of Component Nodes where each parent Node contains its children, used to implement the modular structure of the System
 
_`Type Hierarchy`
 a graph of Type Nodes where each Node is derived from one or more preceding Nodes, except the first Node, which is the root type called `Object`
 
_`Data Flow Chart`
 a directed graph of Component Nodes whose ports are linked with Connectors that represents how data flows between them when the Component is activated
