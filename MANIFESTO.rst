When I dream, I dream of code.  But the code of which I dream is not made of the things of the earth, of ice-sheet semicolons, mud-brown brackets, desert-tan text, grass-plain parends.  The code of which I dream is made of the things above the earth, of the freedom of three-plus dimensions, clouds of floating platonic solids, connected by the curve of rainbows.

Too long, dear programmers, have we dwelt upon the earth.  We have been worms, crawling upon the bare surface of computation, snakes slithering along Turing tapes, caged within our von Neuman architectures.  It should not be so, fellow travelers through thought space, builders of binomial pyramids, gendarmes of the Gendankenexperiment.  We were made for more.

Rise up, take flight!  You were not born in two dimensions, and yet you code therein, flatlanders!  If you cannot code a cube, how then a hypercube?  We talk of trees, crushing them into the Euclidean plane, while the fractal dimensions of trees grow all around us! It should not be so.

We speak in all the recursive complexity of our mother tongue without study or effort and yet, even the simplest of recursive functions remain an impenetrable mystery to those not iniatited into the Masonic rituals of the programmer.  We told epic stories for hours around the campfire with not a single grammatical error, and yet ninety nine of a hundred of us after thousands of hours of dedicated study make a mistake on simple algorithmic problems.  Is there not incongruence in our approach?

Imagine a program without text, without words, without symbols.  Only of shapes, and lines, colors and forms, motion and transformation.  Swimming from port to port through a sea of computation, free as a narwahl in the recursive depths, a bird aflight looping through clouds.  This is as programming should be, fellow sailors.

So let us cast off our chains and rise beyond these bounds and enjoy the unbounded simplicity of a child at the terminal.

Make programming fun again.
