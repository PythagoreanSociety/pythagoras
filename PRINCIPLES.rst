Architectural Principles
------------------------

* `Flow-based programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming>`_
* `Component-based design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering>`_
* `Trait <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)>`_-based inheritance with `C3 linearization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>`_
* `DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`_ and `SSOT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth>`_
* Explicitness and clarity
* Einstein's version of Occam razor: "make it as simple as possible but no simpler"
* Prefer declarative style to encoding logic
