Architectural Principles
------------------------

 * `Flow-based programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming>`_
 * `Component-based design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering>`_
 * `Trait <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)>`_-based inheritance with `C3 linearization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>`_
 * `DRY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`_ and `SSOT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth>`_
 * Explicitness and clarity
 * Einstein's version of Occam razor: "make it as simple as possible but no simpler"
 * Prefer declarative style to encoding logic
 * Transparent persistence
 * Adaptive system interface providing context-dependent suggestions
 * Duck typing and non-invasive type system with optional user-definable type hints and type guards
 * Transparently distributed nature of a system where all resources are abstracted from location
 * Native support for network addressing (URLs)
